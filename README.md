# Forge Kanban Studio

A premium, Trello-style collaborative Kanban Board application built autonomously by a two-agent AI system (Hermes + OpenClaw) orchestrated through Slack.

**Live URL**: https://dist-swart-iota-57.vercel.app
**Backend URL**: https://forge2-qualifier-abhinavdhawan-production.up.railway.app

> **Note**: The frontend is deployed on Vercel and the backend API is deployed on Railway (Laravel + SQLite). Both are fully connected in the cloud.

## Core Features
1. **Boards → Lists → Cards**: Create boards with multiple lists (To-Do, In Progress, Done). Add cards and move them between lists.
2. **Card Details**: Each card has a title, description, and inline editing.
3. **Tags / Labels**: Add colored tags to cards (bug, design, feature, urgent, etc.) with label filtering.
4. **Assign Members**: Add team members and assign cards to them.
5. **Due Dates**: Set due dates on cards; overdue cards are visually flagged with red badges.
6. **Drag & Drop**: Move cards between columns using HTML5 drag-and-drop.
7. **Glassmorphic Dark Mode UI**: Premium design with backdrop blur, gradients, and smooth animations.

## Models Used & Routing Rationale

| Agent | Model | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **Hermes** (Orchestrator / Brain) | Google `gemini-2.5-flash` | Large context window ideal for planning and task decomposition; strong reasoning; generous free tier via AI Studio |
| **OpenClaw** (Coder / Hands) | Ollama `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | Purpose-built for code generation; runs locally with zero rate limits; fast inference for rapid file writes |

**Routing strategy**: Stronger model (Gemini) for planning/reasoning, lighter coding-specific model (qwen2.5-coder) for execution — optimizes for speed and reliability with zero cost.

---

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Backend (Laravel API)
```bash
cd backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env        # Ensure DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve --port=8000
```
API runs at: `http://localhost:8000/api`

### 2. Frontend (React + Vite)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
App runs at: `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Open the app
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. The board auto-creates on first load.

## Agent Setup

### Hermes (Orchestrator)
- Config: `hermes.config.json`
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash` via Google AI Studio
- Memory: persistent local storage (`.hermes/memory/`)
- Skill: `skills/status-report/SKILL.md`
- Autonomous cron: posts progress updates to `#sprint-main`

### OpenClaw (Coder)
- Config: `openclaw.json`
- Model: `qwen2.5-coder:7b` via Ollama (local)
- Workspace: `f:\FORGE 2`
- Slack integration: Socket Mode

### Slack Channels
| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `#sprint-main` | Human ↔ Hermes. Goals, plans, status updates |
| `#agent-coder` | Hermes → OpenClaw. Coding tasks and reports |
| `#agent-orchestrator` | Hermes planning trees and state transitions |
| `#agent-log` | Raw build logs, test outputs, system status |

---

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.3), REST API, Eloquent ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (zero-config)
- **Frontend**: React 19 (Vite 6), Axios
- **Styling**: Custom CSS, glassmorphic dark mode
- **Drag & Drop**: HTML5 native DnD API
- **Deploy**: Vercel (frontend)
